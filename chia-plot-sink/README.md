# chia-plot-sink

Final copy engine to receive plots from one or more plotters via TCP and distribute to multiple disks in parallel.

Plot-sink acts as a TCP server listening for connections from plotters, run `chia_plot_sink` on any machine hosting disks as follows:

```
./chia_plot_sink -- /mnt/disk0/ /mnt/disk1/ ...
```

On the plotting machine or machines, set `-d @ip.of.plot.sink` for transfer over network (should be at least 10Gb for a single plotter making 3 minute plots). If the drives are on the plotter itself, use `-d @localhost` or use the hostname of the machine such as `-d @DESKTOP-ABCDEF12` on windows.

```
./cuda_plot_kxx -n -1 -C 7 -t /mnt/ssd/ -d @<HOSTNAME> -c <pool_contract> -f <farmer_key>
```

If plot_sink is taken offline or disconnected (such as temporarily stopped for changing the disk outputs) the plotter will give errors while it is off, but will resume normal operation when it is back online.
