# MMX-node for compressed plots

This is the binary version of `mmx-node` that supports compressed plots (as well as regular).

## Installation

### Windows

On Windows you just have to download and install the latest binary release, see: https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/mmx-binaries/releases

### Linux

See https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/mmx-node/wiki/Installation for installing the required system dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/mmx-binaries.git
cp -r ~/mmx-node/config/local mmx-binaries/mmx-node/linux/x86_64/config/
cd mmx-binaries/mmx-node/linux/x86_64
./run_node.sh
```

Ajust `~/mmx-node/config/local` to your previous mmx-node installation, and if not available, ignore this line.

You also need to copy over your wallet that is needed for farming your plots.

Note: Make sure to open a new terminal to execute the above commands.
